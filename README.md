# Avatar VGG Face Generation from Photos

Reference:
https://patniemeyer.github.io/2018/10/29/generating-memoji-from-photos.html

## eval-memoji.lua

This script grabs screenshots from a specified region of the screen, scores them with VGG Face against a folder of reference photos, and saves each captured image to a folder naming the file with its score. The script waits for you to hit enter on the keyboard for each capture.

## compare-memoji-multi.lua

This script takes a folder of references and a folder of target photos and uses VGG Face to rank the targets based on the output of a selected layer of the network and a simple dot product similarity measure. The top three matching images are displayed along with their scores.

If you have a folder of ranked output from eval-memoji.lua representing e.g. a Memoji with each feature variation, you can run this script on that output folder to match new reference files or experiment with other similarity metrics.

 `brew upgrade package` to update it.

Run the `install` script.
